# Fitness

Physical health is as important as mental health. I have loved fitness in many different forms throughtout my life. From tennis, to track, to running and trail running, to biking to lifting weights. Anything is helpful as long as you are particapting in something! Here are some of my favorite things for working out! 

## Peloton

We have been avid Peloton users for a few years now and really enjoy it! Great for those cold days, extra hot days or just when you don't want to get out. 

If you'd like $100 off a peloton please click this referral link: [Buy a peloton!](https://account.onepeloton.com/referral/f0aa8f13a5274408b93ab1e2020b13a9?cfuList=bike%2B%2Cbike&guestPassCode=OTJiYTNlNGZiYTljNGMzZjhlY2ExZTViZDY1ZjRiMDh8Y2M4OGVhNTk3ZDcyNGVhNDg2M2RkNjMyYjNmZWMyM2Y=)


## Weight Lifting

Lifting weights is essential to health and life. This has been proven over and over. If you aren't sure where to start check out my current and other favorite lifting accounts:

I currently subscribe to Hungry Fitness and workout in my garage. 30 mins of lifting 3-4x a week is my happy place. 
Achidi is an amazing trainer and will get you to your goals! Hit him up for personalized coaching. 

No matter what you choose, choose to move daily at least 30 minutes. 

## Food

Food is fuel. Thats how it should be. Are there things you should eat to live longer and feel better? Yes for sure. The more plants you eat- the better. I highly recommend the following books: 

* The Blue Zones by Dan Buettner
* How Now to Die by Michael Greger
* Forks over Knives by Gene Stone
